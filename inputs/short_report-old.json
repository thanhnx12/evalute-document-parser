      "question": "What digital infrastructure and skills are needed for the progress of technologies in agriculture?",
      "answer": "As these technologies progress, all countries will need stronger digital infrastructure, particularly high-speed and high-quality Internet connections. This requires public and private investments in information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure along with regulations to foster competition in the telecommunications sector. Governments should also address the connectivity gaps between small and large firms and between urban and rural regions. Skills are needed for adopting existing technologies, for basic use, for adapting these technologies, and finally for creating new ones. For developing countries, it is particularly important to have the capacity to adapt and modify technologies since these are likely to be used in circumstances different from those in which they were originally developed.",

      "question": "What role does international collaboration play in sustainable production in developing countries?",
      "answer": "In developing countries, opening green windows is unlikely to happen naturally as a result of businesses seeking greater efficiency and profits; it has to be the consequence of deliberate government action. The least technologically able countries cannot seize green opportunities without the support of the international community and official development assistance. This should be based on equitable partnerships to build local innovation capabilities and marshal the necessary technologies.",

      "answer": "Reforming intellectual property rights (IPR) is necessary for developing countries because the current IPR regime makes it difficult for new producers to enter the market. Historically, developing economies have often copied production processes, but now tighter IPR rules hinder this. Reforming the international IPR system would enable developing countries to manage their systems to support climate action based on the needs of different sectors and stages of development.",

      "answer": "During the COVID-19 crisis, the WTO allowed eligible Members until 2027 to produce and supply vaccines without the consent of the patent holder to address the pandemic. Similarly, flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement should be provided for environmentally-sound technologies to ensure that the trade regime is more consistent with climate change agreements.",

This can be achieved through models like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Paris Agreement of 2015, and the agreements for the Sustainable Development Goals. Governance mechanisms should also be put in place to avoid the North-South divide in knowledge management and ensure that developing countries' views and priorities are fully considered.",

Research institutions could bring products or processes close to technology maturity and invite private companies to take care of rapid deployment. Alternatively, they might take concepts only to the laboratory stage or to early demonstration projects. The international community can offset the bias towards the priorities of developed countries by shifting research from the national to the multinational level, based on open innovation where all results are available to international experts and knowledge communities.",

UNCTAD is currently carrying out pilot projects involving three African countries to build capacity for technology assessment. This system should also consider how developing countries can be systematically supported to use such technologies.",

      "question": "Why is regional and South-South cooperation important for technological innovations in addressing the global climate crisis?",
      "answer": "Regional and South-South cooperation is important because technological innovations to address the global climate crisis should increasingly be generated at transnational or even global levels. However, cooperation has been limited, even in issues where countries in the same region often face similar problems. Researchers and investors in poorer countries have little incentive to cooperate with their regional peers and are more likely to enter research projects with developed countries and emerging economies which can offer access to world-class research and laboratories as well as computing power. Moreover, small and vulnerable countries also have limited domestic markets to attract local or international investment in the manufacture of goods related to green innovation.",

      "answer": "The proposed multilateral challenge fund “Innovations for Our Common Future” is aimed at creating multiple incentives for companies and entrepreneurs in developing countries to develop their own ideas and transfer them to practice. The fund would be funded by international organizations, donors, and international philanthropy to mobilize creative thinking and stimulate innovations that could respond to many global challenges. The next step would be to design a global green innovation competition, with criteria for assessing projects based on the extent to which they incorporate North-South and South-South STI cooperation for green innovation.",
