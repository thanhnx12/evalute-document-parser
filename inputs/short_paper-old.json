      "question": "What is the main issue with using public blockchain in supply chain systems?",
      "answer": "The main issue with using public blockchain in supply chain systems is that the distribution information, which can be private, is made public since the information recorded in the public blockchain can be read by anyone.",

      "question": "What method does the paper propose to preserve privacy while securing traceability in a supply chain system using public blockchain?",

      "answer": "Traceability in the supply chain is important because it helps in identifying and managing the flow of materials, goods, and related information. It is crucial for preventing counterfeit products and ensuring the safety of products, as demonstrated by the 2015 E. coli outbreak at Chipotle Mexican Grill where contaminated ingredients could not be tracked.",

      "answer": "The related work section discusses several blockchain-based systems that have been proposed for improving the traceability of products in supply chains. These systems include POMS [3] for managing product ownership, Kim et al. [4] for tracking products using traceable resource units (TRUs), and Huang et al.

The distribution of a product is initiated by the manufacturer’s registration of the product information with PMC after confirming that the manufacturer is registered with MMC and is associated with the product. PMC records the raw blockchain address, not the encrypted address, for the manufacturer only, as the manufacturer wants to prove that it has manufactured the product. Anyone can freely identify the manufacturer of the product by viewing the first owner recorded in PMC.",

      "answer": "The system verifies traceability and privacy by considering fraudulent activities by attackers. For traceability, there are three possible attack vectors: interfering with decryption of the owner’s encrypted address, impersonating the owner or recipient, and collusion between the owner and the recipient. The first attack is mitigated by the proof verification in Step 7, which always fails if a statement encrypted with a public key other than the manufacturer’s is recorded. The second attack is impossible due to the soundness of zero-knowledge proof. The third attack is possible but can be addressed in future work. For privacy, the system ensures that the encrypted address is secure using 254-bit elliptic curve cryptography, and the zero-knowledge proof used in the proposed method does not allow the recovery of information such as the address and the secret token.",

      "question": "What are the future work directions for the proposed method?",
      "answer": "There are two issues that remain to be addressed in the future. The first issue is consideration of ways to reduce the transaction fees. Most of the transaction fees in the proposed method arise from the deployment process of the Verification Contract (VC). Instead of the owner deploying VC for each distribution, the manufacturer could deploy it in advance. If supply chain parties use a pre-deployed VC, we can expect a significant reduction in the fees because of having only a one-time VC deployment fee. The second issue is to extend the method so that it can be applied to the assembly and disassembly of products. The proposed method assumes only the distribution of a single product without modification, that is, distribution of a finished product. Therefore, if it could be applied to the assembly and disassembly of products, it could be applied to the distribution of products other than finished products.",
