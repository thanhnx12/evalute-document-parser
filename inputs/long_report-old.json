      "question": "What are the key challenges that emerging markets face in terms of financial services and how can blockchain technology help address them?",
      "answer": "Emerging markets often lack connectivity infrastructure and trusted institutions and counterparties. Distributed ledgers may provide some of the infrastructure these markets need. Blockchain technology can help address challenges such as Know-Your-Customer gaps, de-risking by global financial institutions, and the costs and inefficiencies of processing remittances through the interlinked ledger system that is today’s correspondent banking network infrastructure.",

      "question": "What are the potential use cases for blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies and how are they being explored?",
      "answer": "Sound use cases for blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies are yet to be validated at scale. Many of the proposed implementations remove key attributes of distributed ledgers (for example, distributed write capability or absence of intermediaries) in order to integrate blockchains into existing institutional structures and business interactions. Many proofs of concept to date have focused on the question ‘Can this be done using a blockchain?’ rather than ‘Is blockchain the most efficient and effective way to do this?’",
