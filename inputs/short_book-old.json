      "answer": "John Galt wrote and published his work quickly, sending portions of manuscript to the printer as soon as he finished them.

Galt was usually involved in all stages of the publication process and undertook proof-corrections himself, except in cases where he developed especially close working relationships with a publisher or fellow writer and allowed that person editorial control. Manuscripts and proofs of Galt’s published fiction have not survived for most of his works.",
